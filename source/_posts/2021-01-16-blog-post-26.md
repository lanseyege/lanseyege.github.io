# Measure Thoery: Chp 6. Differentiation

In this chapter we look at two aspects of the relationship between differentiation and integration.

## Change of Variable in $\mathbb{R}^d$

Let $M_d$ be the set of all $d$ by $d$ matrices with real entries, and let $D$ be a real-valued function on $M_d$. 
  - The function $D$ is **multilinear** if for each $i$ and each choice of $A_j, j\neq i$ the map $A_i \rightarrow D(A)$ is linear,
  - is **alternating** if $D(A) = 0$ holds whenever two of the columns of $A$ are equal, and
  - is a **determinant** if it is multilinear, is alternating, and satisfies $D(I) = 1$ 



## Differentiation of Measures 

***Theorem 6.2.1 (Vitali Covering Theorem).*** Let $A$ be an arbitrary nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}_d$, and let $\mathscr{V}$ be a Vitali covering of $A$. Then there is a finite or infinite sequence $\{C_n\}$ of disjoint sets that belong to $\mathscr{V}$ and are such that $\cup_n C_n$ contains $\lambda$-almost every point in A.
