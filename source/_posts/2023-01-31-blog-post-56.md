# Zero-Knowledge Proof

## prelimaries

A **One-way function** is an invertible function that is easy to compute, but whose inverse is difficult to compute. 

Secure PKCs are built using one-way functions that have a ***trapdoor**. The trapdoor is a piece of auxiliary information that allows the inverse to be easily computed. 

### The Discrete Logarithm Problem

**Definition** Let $g$ be a primitive root for $\mathbb{F}_p$ and let $h$ be a nonzero element of $\mathbb{F}_p$. The ***Discrete Logarithm Problem*** (DLP) is the problem of finding an exponent $x$ such that 

$$
g^x \equiv h \quad (\text{mod } p). 
$$

The number $x$ is called the ***discrete logarithm*** of $h$ to the base $g$ and is denoted by $\log_g(h)$.


**Definition** Let $G$ be a group whose group law we denote by the symbol $\star$. The ***Discrete Logarithm Problem*** for $G$ is to determine, for any two given elements $g$ and $h$ in $G$, an integer $x$ satisfying

$$
\underbrace{g \star g \star g \star \cdots \star g}_{x \text{ times}} = h
$$

**Definition**. Let $p$ be a prime number and $g$ an integer. The $\textit{Diffie-Hellman Problem}$ (DHP) is the problem of computing the value of $g^{ab}(\text{mod } p)$ from the known values of $g^a (\text{mod }p)$ and $g^b (\text{mod }p)$.
