# Measure Thoery: Chp 4. Signed and Complex Measures

In this chapter we study signed and complex measures, which are defined to be the countably additive functions from a $\sigma$-algebra to $[−\infty, +\infty]$ or to $C$ that have value $0$ on the empty set.

## Signed and Complex Measures 

Let $(X, \mathscr{A} )$ be a measurable space, and let $\mu$ be a function on $\mathscr{A}$ with values in $[−\infty, +\infty]$. If $\mu$ is countably additive and satisfies $\mu(\varnothing) = 0$, then it is a **signed measure**. 


A **complex measure** on $(X, \mathscr{A} )$ is a function $\mu$ from $\mathscr{A}$ to $\mathbb{C}$ that satisfies $\mu(\varnothing) = 0$ and is countably additive. 


***Theorem 4.1.5 (Hahn Decomposition Theorem).*** Let $(X, \mathscr{A})$ be a measurable space, and let $\mu$ be a signed measure on $(X, \mathscr{A} )$. Then there are disjoint subsets $P$ and $N$ of $X$ such that $P$ is a positive set for $\mu$, $N$ is a negative set for $\mu$, and $X = P \cup N$.


***Corollary 4.1.6 (Jordan Decomposition Theorem).*** Every signed measure is the difference of two positive measures, at least one of which is finite.

## Absolute Continuity

Let $(X, \mathscr{A})$ be a measurable space, and let $\mu$ and $v$ be positive measures on $(X, \mathscr{A} )$. Then $ν$ is **absolutely continuous** with respect to $\mu$ if each set $A$ that belongs to $\mathscr{A}$ and satisfies $\mu(A) = 0$ also satisfies $ν(A) = 0$. One sometimes writes $ν \ll \mu$ to indicate that $ν$ is absolutely continuous with respect to $\mu$.


***Theorem 4.2.2 (Radon–Nikodym Theorem).*** Let $(X, \mathscr{A})$ be a measurable space, and let $\mu$ and $ν$ be $\sigma$-finite positive measures on $(X, \mathscr{A})$. If $ν$ is absolutely continuous with respect to $\mu$, then there is an $\mathscr{A}$-measurable function $g: X \rightarrow [0,+\infty)$ such that $ν(A) = \int_A g d\mu$ holds for each A in $\mathscr{A}$. The function $g$ is unique up to $\mu$-almost everywhere equality. 



## Singularity

Let $(X, \mathscr{A})$ be a measurable space. A positive measure $\mu$ on $(X, \mathscr{A})$ is **concentrated** on the $\mathscr{A}$-measurable set $E$ if $\mu (E^c) = 0$. 

Suppose that $\mu$ and $ν$ are positive, signed, or complex measures on $(X, \mathscr{A} )$. Then $\mu$ and $ν$ are **mutually singular** if there is an $\mathscr{A}$-measurable set $E$ such that $\mu$ is concentrated on $E$ and $ν$ is concentrated on $E^c$. ($\mu \perp v$)


***Theorem 4.3.2 (Lebesgue Decomposition Theorem).*** Let $(X, \mathscr{A} )$ be a measurable space, let $\mu$ be a positive measure on $(X, \mathscr{A} )$, and let $ν$ be a finite signed, complex, or $\sigma$-finite positive measure on $(X, \mathscr{A} )$. Then there are unique finite signed, complex, or positive measures $ν_a$ and $ν_s$ on $(X, \mathscr{A} )$ such that
  - $ν_a$ is absolutely continuous with respect to $\mu$,
  - $ν_s$ is singular with respect to $\mu$, and
  - $v = v_a + v_s$

The decomposition $ν =ν_a + ν_s$ is called the **Lebesgue decomposition** of $ν$, while $ν_a$ and $ν_s$ are called the **absolutely continuous** and **singular** parts of $ν$.

## Functions of Finite Variation 


## The Duals of the $L^p$ Spaces

***Theorem 4.5.1.*** Let $(X, \mathscr{A} ,\mu)$ be a measure space, let $p$ satisfy $1 \leq p < +\infty$, and let $q$ be defined by $1/p+1/q= 1$. If $p = 1$ and $\mu$ is $\sigma$-finite, or if $1 < p < +\infty$ and $\mu$ is arbitrary, then the operator $T$ defined above is an isometric isomorphism of $L^q(X, \mathscr{A} ,\mu)$ onto $(L^p(X, \mathscr{A} , \mu))^\star$.
