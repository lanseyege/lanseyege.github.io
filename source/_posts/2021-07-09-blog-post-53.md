##  Offline Imitation Learning with a Misspecified Simulator 

This work investigate policy learning in the condition of a few expert demonstrations and a simulator with misspecified dynamics. 

**Story:** There are two current approaches to apply RL in real-world without a costly trial-and-error process: ***imitation learning*** and ***to train a policy in a simulator***. This paper images a feasible scenario that we have a few expert demonstrations and a simulator with misspecified dynamics.
