# Measure Thoery: Chp 7. Measures on Locally Compact Spaces

This chapter is devoted to the Riesz representation theorem and related results.

## Locally Compact Spaces

A topological space is **locally compact** if each of its points has an open neighborhood whose closure is compact.



## The Riesz representation Theorem

***Theorem 7.2.8 (Riesz Representation Theorem).*** Let $X$ be a locally compact Hausdorff space, and let $I$ be a positive linear functional on $\mathscr{K} (X)$. Then there is a unique regular Borel measure $\mu$ on $X$ such that

$$
I( f) = \int f d \mu
$$

holds for each $f$ in $\mathscr{K} (X)$.
