## Measurable Functions

Let $(X, \mathscr{A})$ be a measurable space, and let $A$ be a subset of $X$ that belongs to $\mathscr{A}$. For a function $f : A \rightarrow [-\infty, +\infty]$ the conditions
  - for each real number $t$ the set $\left\{ x \in A : f(x) \leq t \right\}$ belongs to $\mathscr{A}$,
  - for each real number $t$ the set $\left\{ x \in A : f(x) < t \right\}$ belongs to $\mathscr{A}$,
  - for each real number $t$ the set $\left\{ x \in A : f(x) \geq t \right\}$ belongs to $\mathscr{A}$, and 
  - for each real number $t$ the set $\left\{ x \in A : f(x) > t \right\}$ belongs to $\mathscr{A}$,

are equivalent. A **function** $f : A \rightarrow [-\infty, +\infty]$ is **measurable** with respect to $\mathscr{A}$ if it satisfies one, and hence all of the conditions.

## Properties That Holds Almost Everywhere

Let $(X, \mathscr{A}, \mu)$ be a measure space. A property of points of $X$ is said to hold $\mu$-almost everywhere if the set of points in $X$ at which it fails to hold is **$\mu$-negligible** ($\mu$-a.e. or a.e.$[\mu]$). 


## The Integral 

Let $(X, \mathscr{A})$ be a measurable space. We will denote by $\mathscr{S}$ the collection of all simple real-valued $\mathscr{A}$-measurable functions on $X$ and by $\mathscr{S}_+$ the collection of nonnegative functions in $\mathscr{S}$. If $f \in \mathscr{S}_+$ and is given by $f = \sum_{i=1}^m a_i \chi_{A_{i}}$ ($a_i \in \mathbb{R}_+ $, and $A_i$ disjoint subsets of $X$ in $\mathscr{A}$), then $\int f d \mu$, the **integral** of $f$ with respect to $\mu$, is defined to be $\sum_{i=1}^m a_i \mu(A_i)$. 


## Limit Theorems 

***The Monotone Convergence Theorem*** Let $(X, \mathscr{A}, \mu)$ be a measure space, and let $f$ and $f_1, f_2, \ldots $ be $[0, +\infty]$-valued $\mathscr{A}$-measurable functions on $X$. Suppose that 

$$
f_1(x) \leq f_2(x) \leq \ldots
$$

and 

$$
f(x) = \lim_n f_n(x)
$$

hold at $\mu$-almost every $x \in X$. Then $\int f d\mu = \lim_n \int f_n d\mu$. 


***Beppo Levi’s Theorem*** Let $(X, \mathscr{A}, \mu)$ be a measure space, and let $\sum_{k=1}^\infty f_k$ be an infinite series whose terms are $[0, +\infty]$-valued $\mathscr{A}$-measurable functions on $X$. Then 

$$
\int \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} f_k d \mu = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \int f_k d \mu
$$

***Fatou’s Lemma***  Let $(X, \mathscr{A}, \mu)$ be a measure space, and let $\left\{ f_n \right\}$ be a sequence of $[0, +\infty]$-valued $\mathscr{A}$-measurable functions on $X$. Then

$$
\int \underline{\lim }_{n} f_{n} d \mu \leq \underline{\lim }_{n} \int f_{n} d \mu
$$


***Lebesgue’s Dominated Convergence Theorem*** Let $(X, \mathscr{A}, \mu)$ be a measure space, let $g$ be a $[0, +\infty]$-valued integrable function on $X$, and let $f$ and $f_1, f_2, \ldots $ be $[-\infty, +\infty]$-valued $\mathscr{A}$-measurable functions on $X$ such that 

$$
f(x) = \lim_n f_n(x)
$$

and 

$$
\lvert f_n(x) \rvert \leq g(x), n = 1, 2, \ldots
$$

hold at $\mu$-almost every $x \in X$. Then $f$ and $f_1, f_2, \ldots$ are integrable, and $\int f d \mu = \lim_n \int f_n d \mu$. 


## The Riemann Integral 

***Theorem 2.5.4*** Let $[a, b]$ be a closed bounded interval, and let $f$ be a bounded real-valued function on $[a, b]$. Then

  - $f$ is Riemann integrable if and only if it is continuous at almost every point of $[a, b]$, and 
  - if $f$ is Riemann integrable, then $f$ is Lebesgue integrable and the Riemann and Lebesgue integrals of $f$ coincide.
