## Algebras and Sigma-Algebras

***Algebras*** Let $X$ be an arbitrary set. A collection $\mathscr{A}$ of subsets of $X$ is an ***algebra*** on $X$ if 

  - $X \in \mathscr{A}$, 
  - for each set $A$ that belongs to $\mathscr{A}$, the set $A^c$ belongs to $\mathscr{A}$,
  - for each finite sequence $A_1, \ldots, A_n$ of sets that belong to $\mathscr{A}$, the set $\cup_{i=1}^{n} A_{i}$ belongs to $\mathscr{A}$, and 
  - for each finite sequence $A_1, \ldots, A_n$ of sets that belongs to $\mathscr{A}$, the set $\cap_{i=1}^{n} A_{i}$ belongs to $\mathcal{A}$. 


***Sigma-Algebras*** Let $X$ be an arbitrary set. A collection $\mathscr{A}$ of subsets of $X$ is a $\sigma$-algebra on $X$ if 

  - $X \in \mathscr{A}$, 
  - for each set $A$ that belongs to $\mathscr{A}$, the set $A^c$ belongs to $\mathscr{A}$,
  - for each finite sequence $A_1, \ldots, A_n$ of sets that belong to $\mathscr{A}$, the set $\cup_{i=1}^{\infty} A_{i}$ belongs to $\mathscr{A}$, and 
  - for each finite sequence $A_1, \ldots, A_n$ of sets that belongs to $\mathscr{A}$, the set $\cap_{i=1}^{\infty} A_{i}$ belongs to $\mathcal{A}$. 


## Measures 

Let $X$ be a set, and let $\mathscr{A}$ be a $\sigma$-algebra on $X$. A function $\mu$ whose domain is the $\sigma$-algebra $\mathscr{A}$ and whose values belong to the extended half-line $[0, +\infty]$ is said to be countably additive if it satisfies

$$
\mu (\cup_{i=1}^\infty A_i) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \mu(A_i)
$$

for each infinite sequence $\left\{ A_i \right\}$ of disjoint sets that belong to $\mathscr{A}$. A **measure** (or a countably additive measure) on $\mathscr{A}$ is a function $\mu : \mathscr{A} \rightarrow [0, +\infty]$ that satisfies $\mu(\varnothing) = 0$ and is countably additive. A triplet $(X, \mathscr{A}, \mu)$ is often called a **measure space**. 


## Outer Measures
Let $X$ be a set, and let $\mathscr{P}(X)$ be the collection of all subsets of $X$. An **outer measure** on $X$ is a function $\mu^\star : \mathscr{P}(X) \rightarrow [0, +\infty] $ such that 

  - $\mu^\star(\varnothing) = 0$, 
  - if $A \subseteq B \subseteq X$, then $\mu^\star (A) \leq \mu^\star(B)$, and 
  - if $\left\{A_n \right\}$ is an infinite sequence of subsets of $X$, then $\mu^\star(\cup_n A_n) \leq \sum_n \mu^\star (A_n)$.

Thus an outer measure on $X$ is a monotone and countably subadditive function from $\mathscr{P}(X)$ to $[0, + \infty]$ whose value at $\varnothing$ is $0$. 

**$\mu^\star$-measurable (or measurable with respect to $\mu^\star$)** Let $X$ be a set, and let $\mu^\star$ be an outer measure on $X$. A subset $B$ of $X$ is $\mu^\star$-measurable if 

$$
\mu^\star (A) = \mu^\star (A \cap B) + \mu^\star (A \cap B^c)
$$

holds for every subset $A$ of $X$. 

***Theorem 1.3.6*** Let $X$ be a set, let $\mu^\star$ be an outer measure on $X$, and let $\mathscr{M}_{\mu^\star}$ be the collection of all $\mu^\star$-measurable subsets of $X$. Then
  - $\mathscr{M}_{\mu^{*}}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra, and 
  - the restriction of $\mu^\star$ to $\mathscr{M}_{\mu^{*}}$ is a measure on $\mathscr{M}_{\mu^{*}}$. 

## Lebesgue Measure

The **Borel $\sigma$-algebra** on $\mathbb{R}^d$ is the $\sigma$-algebra on $\mathbb{R}^d$ generated by the collection of open subsets of $\mathbb{R}^d$; it is denoted by $\mathscr{B}\left(\mathbb{R}^{d}\right)$. The Borel subsets of $\mathbb{R}^d$ are those that belong to $\mathscr{B}\left(\mathbb{R}^{d}\right)$. 

## Completeness and Regularity 

Let $(X, \mathscr{A}, \mu)$ be a measure space. The measure $\mu$ is **complete** if the relations $A \in \mathscr{A}, \mu(A) = 0$, and $B \subseteq A$ together imply that $B \in \mathscr{A}$. It's sometimes convenient to call a subset $B$ of $X$ $\mu$-negligible (or $\mu$-null) if there is a subset $A$ of $X$ such that $A \in \mathscr{A}, B \subseteq A$, and $\mu(A) = 0$. Thus the measure $\mu$ is complete if and only if every $\mu$-negligible subset of $X$ belongs to $\mathscr{A}$.

If $\mu^\star$ is an outer measure on the set $X$ and if $\mathscr{M}_{\mu^\star}$ is the $\sigma$-algebra of all $\mu^\star$-measurable subsets of $X$, then the restriction of $\mu^\star$ to $\mathscr{M}_{\mu^\star}$ is **complete**. 


Let $\mathscr{A}$ be a $\sigma$-algebra on $\mathbb{R}^d$ that includes the $\sigma$-algebra $\mathscr{B}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ of Borel sets. A measure $\mu$ on $(\mathbb{R}^d, \mathscr{A})$ is **regular** if 
  - each compact subset $K$ of $\mathbb{R}^d$ satisfies $\mu(K) < +\infty$
  - each set $A$ in $\mathscr{A}$ satisfies
$$
\mu(A) = \inf \left\{ \mu(U) : U \text{ is open and } A \subseteq U\right\}, \text{ and}
$$

  - each open subset $U$ of $\mathbb{R}^d$ satisfies

$$
\mu(U) = \sup \left\{ \mu(K) : K \text{ is compact and } K \subseteq U \right\},
$$


## Dynkin Classes

Let $X$ be a set. A collection $\mathscr{D}$ of subsets of $X$ is a **d-system** (or a Dynkin class) on $X$ if
  - $X \in \mathscr{D}$,
  - $A - B \in \mathscr{D}$ whenever $A , B \in \mathscr{D}$ and $A \supseteq B$, and
  - $\cup_n A_n \in \mathscr{D}$ whenever $\left\{ A_n \right\}$ is an increasing sequence of sets in $\mathscr{D}$. 

A collection of subsets of $X$ is a **$\pi$-system** on $X$ if it is closed under the formation of finite intersections.
