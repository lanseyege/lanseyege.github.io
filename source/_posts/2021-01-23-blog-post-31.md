# Manifold Learning

<!-- more -->

What's Manifold Learning? **Manifold Learning** is merely using the geometric properties of the data in high dimensions to implement the following things:

  - Clustering: Find groups of similar points. Given $\left\{ X_1, \ldots, X_n \right\}$, build a function $f : X \rightarrow \{ 1, \ldots, k \}$. Two "close" points should be in the same cluster.
  - Dimensionality Reduction: Project points in a lower dimensional space while preserving structure. Given $\{ X_1, \ldots, X_n \}$ in $R^D$, build a function $f : R^d \rightarrow R^d$, where $ d << D$. "Closeness" should be preserved. 
  - Semi-Supervised, Supervised: Given labelled and unlabeled points, build a labeling function. Given $\{ (X_1, Y_1), \ldots, (X_n, Y_n) \}$, build $f : X \rightarrow Y$. Two "close" points should have the same label. 

Manifold Learning assumes that the observed data lie on a low-dimensional manifold embedded in a higher-diemnsional space. This is known as **manifold assumption**.
