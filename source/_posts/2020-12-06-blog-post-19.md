# Wavelets on Graphs via Spectral Graph Theory

<!-- more -->

## Abstract

We propose a novel method for constructing wavelet transforms of functions dened on the vertices of an arbitrary nite weighted graph. Our approach is based on dening scaling using the the graph analogue of the Fourier domain, namely the spectral decomposition of the discrete graph Laplacian $\mathcal{L}$. Given a wavelet generating kernel $g$ and a scale parameter $t$, we define the scaled wavelet operator $T_g^t = g(t\mathcal{L})$. The spectral graph wavelets are then formed by localizing this operator by applying it to an indicator function. We explore the localization properties of the wavelets in the limit of ne scales. Additionally, we present a fast Chebyshev polynomial approximation algorithm for computing the transform that avoids the need for diagonalizing $\mathcal{L}$. 

## Introduction

Some data are defined on regular Euclidean spaces, such as time seriers data, image or videos. However, many interesting applications involve data defined on more topologically complicated domains.
