# Measure Thoery: Chp 3. Convergence

In this chapter we look in some detail at the convergence of sequences of functions.

## Modes of Convergence

***Converge in measure*** Let $(X, \mathscr{A}, \mu)$ be a measure space, and let $f$ and $f_1, f_2, \ldots$ be real-valued $\mathscr{A}$-measurable functions on $X$. The sequence $\left\{ f_n \right\}$ converges to $f$ **in measure** if

$$
\lim_n \mu(\left\{ x \in X : \lvert f_n(x) - f(x) \rvert > \epsilon \right\}) = 0
$$

holds for each positive $\epsilon$. 


***Converge almost everywhere*** The sequence $\left\{ f_n \right\}$ converges to $f$ almost everywhere if $f(x) = \lim_n f_n(x)$ holds at $\mu$-almost every point $x$ in $X$. 

***Proposition 3.1.2*** Let $(X, \mathscr{A}, \mu)$ be a measure space, and let $f$ and $f_1, f_2, \ldots$ be real-valued $\mathscr{A}$-measurable functions on $X$. If $\mu$ is finite and if $\left\{ f_n \right\}$ converges to $f$ almost everywhere, then $\left\{ f_n \right\}$ converges to $f$ in measure. 


***Proposition 3.1.3*** Let $(X, \mathscr{A}, \mu)$ be a measure space, and let $f$ and $f_1, f_2, \ldots$ be real-valued $\mathscr{A}$-measurable functions on $X$. If $\left\{f_n\right\}$ converges to $f$ in measure, then there is a subsequence of $\left\{ f_n \right\}$ that converges to $f$ almost everywhere. 

***Proposition 3.1.4 (Egoroff's Theorem)*** Let $(X, \mathscr{A}, \mu)$ be a measure space, and let $f$ and $f_1, f_2, \ldots$ be real-valued $\mathscr{A}$-measurable functions on $X$. If $\mu$ is finite and if $\left\{ f_n \right\}$ converges to $f$ almost everywhere, then for each positive number $\epsilon$ there is a subset $B$ of $X$ that belongs to $\mathscr{A}$, satisfies $\mu(B^c) < \epsilon$, and is such that $\left\{f_n\right\}$ converges to $f$ **uniformly** on $B$. 

It follows from this remark and Egoroff's theorem that on a finite measure space almost everywhere convergence is equivalent to almost uniform convergence. 

***Converge in Mean*** Suppose that $(X, \mathscr{A}, \mu)$ is a measure space and that $f$ and $f_1, f_2, \ldots$ belong to $\mathscr{L}^1 (X, \mathscr{A}, \mu, \mathbb{R})$. Then $\left\{f_n\right\}$ converges to $f$ **in mean** if 

$$
\lim_n \int \lvert f_n - f \rvert d \mu = 0
$$

***Proposition 3.1.5*** Let $(X, \mathscr{A}, \mu)$ is a measure space and that $f$ and $f_1, f_2, \ldots$ belong to $\mathscr{L}^1 (X, \mathscr{A}, \mu, \mathbb{R})$. If $\left\{ f_n \right\}$ converges to $f$ in mean, then $\left\{ f_n \right\}$ converges to f in measure. 

***Proposition 3.1.6*** Let $(X, \mathscr{A}, \mu)$ is a measure space and that $f$ and $f_1, f_2, \ldots$ belong to $\mathscr{L}^1 (X, \mathscr{A}, \mu, \mathbb{R})$. If $\left\{ f_n \right\}$ converges to $f$ almost everywhere or in measure, and if there is a nonnegative extended real-valued integrable function $g$ such that

$$
\lvert f_n \rvert \leq g, (\forall n \in N), \text{ and } \lvert f \rvert \leq g
$$

hold almost everywhere, then $\left\{f_n \right\}$ converges to $f$ in mean. 

## Normed Spaces 

Let $V$ be a vector space over $\mathbb{R}$ (or over $\mathbb{C}$). A **norm** on $V$ is a function $\| \cdot \| : V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ that satisfies 
  - $\|v\| \geq 0$
  - $\|v\| = 0$ if and only if $v = 0$
  - $\|\alpha v\| = \lvert \alpha \rvert \|v\|$, and
  - $\|u+v\| \leq \|u\| + \|v\|$

for each $u$ and $v$ in $V$ and each $\alpha$ in $\mathbb{R}$ (or in $\mathbb{C}$). A **normed vector space** is a vector space together with a norm.

A **metric** on a set $S$ is a function $d : S \times S \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ that satisfies
  - $d(s,t) \geq 0$,
  - $d(s,t) = 0$ if and only if $s=t$,
  - $d(s,t) = d(t,s)$, and
  - $d(r,t) \leq d(r,s) + d(s,t)$

for all $r, s$ and $t$ in $S$. 

Let $d$ be a metric on a set $S$. Then a subset $A $ of $S$ is **dense** in $S$ if for each $s \in S$ and each positive $\epsilon$ there is an element $a$ of $A$ that satisfies $d(s,a)<\epsilon$. 

A sequence $\left\{s_n\right\}$ of elements of $S$ is a **Cauchy sequence** if for each positive number $\epsilon$ there is a positive integer $N$ such that $d(s_m, s_n) < \epsilon$ holds whenever $m \geq N$ and $n\geq N$. If every Cauchy sequence in $S$ converges to a point in $S$, then $S$ is called **complete**. A normed linear space that is complete (with respect to the metric induced by its norm) is called a **Banach space**.


## Definition of $\mathscr{L}^p$ and $L^p$

***$\mathscr{L}^p$ *** Let $(X, \mathscr{A}, \mu)$ be a measure space, and let $p$ satisfy $1 \leq p < +\infty$ ($p$ need not be an integer). Then $\mathscr{L}^p(X, \mathscr{A}, \mu, \mathbb{R})$ is the set of all $\mathscr{A}$-measurable functions $f : X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that $\lvert f \rvert ^p$ is integrable. We define $\| \cdot \| _p$ by

$$
\| f \| _p = (\int \lvert f \rvert ^p d \mu)^{\frac{1}{p}}
$$

A subset $N$ of $X$ is **locally $\mu$-null** (or simply locally null) if for each set $A$ that belongs to $\mathscr{A}$ and satisfies $\mu(A) < +\infty$ the set $A \cap N$ is $\mu$-null.


***Lemma 3.3.1*** Let $p$ satisfy $1 < p < +\infty$, let $q$ be defined by $\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = 1$, and let $x$ and $y$ be nonnegative real numbers. Then

$$
xy \leq \frac{x^p}{p} + \frac{y^q}{q}
$$


***Proposition 3.3.2 (Holder's Inequality)*** Let $(X, \mathscr{A}, \mu)$ be a measure space, and let $p$ and $q$ satisfy $1 \leq p \leq +\infty, 1 \leq q \leq +\infty$, and $\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = 1$. If $f \in \mathscr{L}^p (X, \mathscr{A}, \mu)$ and $g \in \mathscr{L}^q(X, \mathscr{A}, \mu)$, then $fg$ belongs to $\mathscr{L}^1(X, \mathscr{A}, \mu)$ and satisfies $\int \lvert fg \rvert d \mu \leq \|f\|_p \|g\|_q$. 


***Proposition 3.3.3 (Minkownski's Inequality)*** Let $(X, \mathscr{A}, \mu)$ be a measure space, and let $p$ satisfy $1 \leq p \leq +\infty$. If $f$ and $g$ belongs to $\mathscr{L}^p(X, \mathscr{A}, \mu)$, then $f + g$ belongs to $\mathscr{L}^p(X, \mathscr{A}, \mu)$ and $\|f + g \|_p \leq \|f\|_p + \|g\|_p$. 




## Properties of $\mathscr{L}^p$ and $L^p$

***Theorem 3.4.1*** Let $(X, \mathscr{A}, \mu)$ be a measure space, and let $p$ satisfy $1 \leq p \leq +\infty$. Then $L^p(X, \mathscr{A}, \mu)$ is complete under the norm $\| \cdot \|_p$. 



## Dual Spaces

***Proposition 3.5.1*** Let $V_1$ and $V_2$ be normed linear spaces, and let $T : V_1 \rightarrow V_2$ be a linear operator. Then $T$ is continuous if and only if there is a nonnegative number $M$ such that

$$
\| T(V) \| \leq M \| v \|
$$

holds for each $v$ in $V_1$. (Operator $T$ is called bounded.)


***Dual Space*** Let $V$ be a normed linear space. A linear functional on $V$ is a linear operator on $V$ whose values lie in $\mathbb{R}$. We will be particularly concerned with the bounded, that is, continuous, linear functionals on $V$. It is easy to check that the set of all continuous linear functionals on $V$ is a subspace of the vector space of all linear functionals on $V$; this subspace is called the **dual space (or conjugate space)** of $V$ and is denoted by $V^\star$. The space $V^\star$ is sometimes called the **topological dual space** of V in order to distinguish it from the space of all linear functionals on V (which is then called the *algebraic dual space* of V).
