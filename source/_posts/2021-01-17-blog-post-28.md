# Measure Thoery: Chp 8. Polish Spaces and Analytic Sets

<!-- more -->

## Polish Spaces

A **Polish space** is a separable topological space that can be metrized using a complete metric.


## Analytic Sets

Let $X$ be a Polish space. A subset $A$ of $X$ is **analytic** if there is a Polish space $Z$ and a continuous function $f : Z \rightarrow X$ such that $f (Z) = A$.


## The Separation Theorem and Its Consequences

***Theorem 8.3.1.*** Let $X$ be a Polish space, and let $A_1$ and $A_2$ be disjoint analytic subsets of $ X$. Then $A_1$ and $A_2$ can be separated by Borel sets.
