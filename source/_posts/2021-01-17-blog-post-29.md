# Measure Thoery: Chp 9. Haar Measure

## Topological Groups 


A **topological group** is a set $G$ that has the structure of a group (say with group operation $(x,y) \rightarrow xy$) and of a topological space and is such that the operations $(x,y) \rightarrow xy$ and $x \rightarrow xâˆ’1 $ are continuous. 

A **locally compact topological group**, or simply a locally compact group, is a topological group whose topology is locally compact and Hausdorff. 

A **compact group** is a topological group whose topology is compact and Hausdorff.


## The Existence and Uniqueness of Haar Measure

Let $G$ be a locally compact group, and let $\mu$ be a nonzero regular Borel measure on $G$. Then $\mu$ is a left Haar measure (or simply a Haar measure) if it is invariant under left translations (or simply translation invariant), in the sense that $\mu(xA) = \mu(A)$ holds for each $x$ in $G$ and each $A$ in $\mathscr{B}(G)$.


**Theorem 9.2.2.** Let $G$ be a locally compact group. Then there is a left Haar measure on $G$.
